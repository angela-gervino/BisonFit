# Vision Statement
BisonFit will be a fitness app tailored to the needs of those who workout at the Active Living Center.

## What is BisonFit?
BisonFit will be an Android app developed to assist in fitness management for visitors of the Active Living Center. Its user-friendly interface and functional capabilities will help individuals plan their workouts, track their progress, and stay hydrated.

The homepage will serve as a centralized hub, offering a convenient water tracker, Active Living Center operating hours, and a customizable workout list. Users can easily access and create detailed exercise routines by choosing a specific workout. The app allows them to customize these routines by adding, removing, modifying, or rearranging exercises according to their preferences.

The water tracker on the homepage will allow users to stay mindful of their hydration goals by tracking their daily water intake. Additionally, the Active Living Center schedule will keep users informed about the remaining time they have to visit the gym and provide detailed operating hours for each weekday.

## Who is BisonFit for? 
The primary users of BisonFit will be those who frequent the Active Living Center. It caters to individuals of all fitness levels, regardless of their past experience or expertise. 

## Why is BisonFit valuable? 
Unlike other fitness apps and websites that offer fragmented features like water tracking, gym hours information, or workout tracking, BisonFit will bring all these capabilities together in a single, user-friendly app. Fine-tuned for the visitors of the Active Living Center, the app will also show machines provided at the gym, allowing users to plan workouts with greater flexibility.  

## How will BisonFit be successful? 
The success of BisonFit will be measured by 3 metrics. The first two metrics will test whether the functionality of BisonFit is appreciated by both users who haven’t used a workout tracking app before and users who have. If the majority of both types of users appreciate the convenience provided by BisonFit, we will consider the functionality of BisonFit to be a success. 

The third metric will measure whether users appreciate the convenience of having all essential fitness features combined in one place. If the majority of the people give positive feedback regarding this feature, we’ll consider the addition of Active Living Centre specific information a success.

To gather this information, we will conduct a small survey giving app access to 10 individuals who visit the ALC but do not use a fitness tracker and 10 individuals who visit the ALC but do not use a fitness tracker. Both groups will be asked if they like using BisonFit (and for the first group, whether they prefer BisonFit to alternative apps), and whether they appreciate the addition of Active Living Centre specific information. If more than 50% of people reply in the affirmative for both questions, we will consider BisonFit to be a successful app.
