# Workflow 

We are using GitHub flow as described [here](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). 

## Developer task checklist 
* Make sure you understand the task and ask any necessary questions. 
* When you are ready to start, make sure the task is assigned to you and move the issue to the 'Doing' list on the board.
* Make a branch to develop from.

`git checkout -b [your name]/[task name]`

for example: 
`git checkout -b nathan/hello-world`
* Once you are finished implementing a task create a Merge Request, link the task, and assign/ask for review.
